Shopify Boilerplate
======================
This repository provides a suggested directory structure and [Grunt][]
configuration for making the Shopify theme development process as smooth as
possible. It was closely modelled on the setup used at [Disco][] when building Shopify themes.

It ships with a few sample theme files, mostly empty, that demonstrate how thescaffold works. You should be able to slot any number of existing themes or theme frameworks in.

## Dependencies and Setup
You're going to need `nodejs` and `npm` in order to run:

```shell
npm install
```

from the base directory, which should do the rest.
